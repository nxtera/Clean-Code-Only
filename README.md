# Clean-Code-Only

## Introducing a newly designed website detailing the basics of online marketing.

What was my motivation?
I wanted to demonstrate all that I have learned in html and css over the past week to refactor existing code to make it more cleaner and more accessible to meet good practise standards. 

What did I do?
Using a template html and css file containing good but flawed code as a starting point I went over line by line and carefully:
	- Ensured all links function correctly.
	- Reordered and consolidated CSS selectors and properties to follow semantic structure.
	- Commented on various lines of the html and css file to the explain the code and to make more obvious the different sections of the page.
	
What did I learn?
That all good coders follow the 'Scout Rule'! This rule recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it.
